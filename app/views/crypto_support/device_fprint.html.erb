<div>
This service expects iDevice (iPhone / iPod Touch) attributes packed as a hash
named "attributes" in your request, and returns a MD5 digest and hex_digest over
the attributes. It's the only good way of testing ZNDeviceFprint in
CryptoSupport, short of mocking the attribute getter or duplicating the digest
logic.
